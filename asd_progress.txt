-----11 AM, Thursday-----
Narrator: "You work at a bank during a busy day. You're tired from working all night on a PowerPoint or Excel they made you do. 
You are made to do things that are kind of degrading - you went through college to work a job any high school kid with a computer can do.
You wanna quit, but you can't."
Boss: *to you* "James! I need this month's stats and the PowerPoint you needed to do!"
James (you): 
"(quietly) I wish I could say that... (loudly, to boss) Of course, sir!"
Boss: "Thanks, James. You're a good kid."
James: (quietly and ironically) "Thanks..."
Andrew: "Sup, James?"
Narrator: "Andrew's James' best friend. He's the one guy who's truly there for him through anything. James got this job because of him."
James:
"Oh, hey, bro. I'm super tired, can't wait for this day to be over."
Andrew: "Hey, don't forget Saturday night!"
James: "Of course not, bro, I'm dying to go."
Narrator: "James and Andrew are car enthusiasts. Something about cars calms James down, he feels fulfilled when driving...
Andrew is a simpler guy than him, though. Andrew just likes to see a guy's car spit flames or hear a roaring American V8.
Their Saturday night plans were to go to a track, watch some races. They were both very excited to go."
-----5 PM, The Same Day-----
James:
*sigh*
Narrator: "James is always excited when work ends. It's not because he hates it or anything, it just means he gets to speed home in his car."
Christina: "Hey, James. Are you leaving?"
James:
"(to himself) What's with me today? (louder) Oh hey, yeah I'm just about to go home."
Narrator: "Christina is the hot new girl. Everyone likes to do her favors."
Christina: "Oh, cool. Hey, I missed the bus, I think. Can you give me a ride home?"
James:
"Sure."
Christina: "Awesome, thanks. Hey, what kinda car do you drive?"
Narrator: "See, the exciting thing about video games is, you can choose what you drive right there on the spot.
Who's gonna stop you? It's a game."
James:
"A Mercedes S280 sedan."
Christina: "You have a pretty cool car. Thanks for the ride, James!"
Narrator: "So, after you got Christina home safe, you go home too exhausted to do anything at all and just pass out on your couch."
-----12PM, Saturday-----
*Phone Ringing*
James: "Hello?"
Andrew:"Hey man, what are you up to?"
James:
