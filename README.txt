This project's code and story were all written by me.
I'm using CLion IDE, so the CMakeLists.txt and the folders are necessary for the IDE to compile.
The .ilk and .pdb files are also made by my IDE.
I made the cpp files and the h files, and when I compiled them, the IDE made executables.
The language I use is C++ 14!
The Story folder is made by me, and I wrote the story there. 
I needed multiple txt files to do this since I had multiple choices that alter the outcome of the game.
I refer to these choices throughout everything in this Project as "Key Choices". There are 2, making for 6 different ways the story can go.
It's just for organization purposes.
