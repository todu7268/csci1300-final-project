*The first key choice 2*

Narrator: "And that's how James lost a Skyline that wasn't even his to begin with.
He now has a big problem - Gomez. Gomez isn't some two-bit thug, he's built an empire based on street races.
And that's exactly the issue, here. He didn't build an empire by forgiving every moron who lost his cars.
James would pay... with his life."

James: "Hey, man, please. Just tell me how much you want for the car. It's a rental!"

The Demon: "Nah, no way, homie. That GT-R is sick, I want it. Matter of fact, I might even daily it."

James: 

1. "Please, there must be something I can do."

2. "Bro, come on. You got like twice the price of this thing under the hood of that Miata."

The Demon: "Look bro. You lost your car, right? End of fucking story. But here, I'll bite. Who you rent it from? 
Is it one of them big joints or is it someone from our underground... "facilities"?"

James:

1. "I got it from this dude named Gomez."

2. "Big joints don't rent GT-R Skylines. Not like that, anyway."

The Demon: "Oh, this Gomie's car, huh? Well, fuck Gomie. Him and that Kelly girl work together. 
My dad don't like that at all, but Gomie's the best tuner we got up in here. He works for everyone's money.
Personally, I don't like dude at all... So, you lost his car, huh?"

James:

1. "I understand why you don't like him, but, he'll kill me."

2. "I dislike him too but what can I do? I owe him a car, now, man! Come on."

The Demon: "Look, you ain't getting the car back. However, I can do something else for you, if you're down."

James: "What?"

The Demon: "You ever heard of the Phantom?"

James:

1. "The racing kingpin? Yeah."

2. "I got no idea who that is."

The Demon: "He's my dad, and he's always looking for new recruits. Plus, I kinda like you. 
You're a good driver, you almost had me. Not a lot of people can beat me in a race.
Some training, you'll do great. We just have to give you a nice car to work with."

James: 

1. "Damn. I really don't have a choice, do I? Either this or Gomez kills me."

2. "Whatever keeps my head attached to my shoulders!"

The Demon: "Good. Meet me at my dad's garage.
We've got some cars coming in, our boys won a few races over in the desert.
Let's see if we can pick a toy for you to play with. One that I don't want for myself, of course."
*chuckles*

James: "Where do I go?"

The Demon: "X. We meet at the X. Take my Miata there."

-----Phantom's, right after the race-----

Beverly: "Who's this clown, Hector?"

The Demon: "Hang on, now, Beverly. We got a common enemy. That dude's name is... I don't even think I remember it, if he even told me.
But his name now is the Ravager. He's a trainee. I just have to speak to my father about this, but he's the dude I wanna train."

Beverly: "God, Hector, common enemy? What do you think we are, the mafia?"

The Demon: "Chill out. I know what I'm doing, I'm dad's favorite for a reason."

Beverly: "You're cocky, arrogant, and that statement is a complete lie."

The Demon: "Meet my brother, Beverly. 
He races cars like a moron, doesn't even know how to downshift properly, but when it comes to bikes, he's the go-to dude.
Hence the stupid nickname."

James: 

1. "Beverly? Like the Italian Piaggio brand?"

2. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Beverly."

The Demon: "Ight, no time for chit-chat. B, the new cars arrive yet?"

Beverly: "Yeah. Nothing special this week, to be honest.
Couple of Fairladies, some Mustangs. There was a cool Supra MK3, but it was an Auto. 
Got it off some rich kid who doesn't know anything about cars, including how to drive one."

The Demon: "Anything I can use to coach training wheels over here?"

James:

1. Stay Silent

2. "Hey!"

Beverly: "Yeah. Personally I'd go with the Fairlady 370Z. You'll see it - the matte black with the purple angel eyes.
Other than that, two more cars are good to drive for beginners on training wheels.
I'd say the Porsche Cayman that came with an RB26 swap is pretty dope, and, what was the third one that caught my eye... 
Oh, a rocket bunny RX-7 came in. It's right hand drive, though, so... maybe not? I don't know, let your boy here decide."

James:

1. "Oh, that Z sounds AWESOME."
