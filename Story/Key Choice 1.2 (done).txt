*The second key choice 2, if you chose the first key choice to be 1.*

Kelly: *stares at you for a few seconds blankly*
"This is hopeless..."

James: 

1. "Isn't driving an automatic normal these days?"

2. "Come on, how am I supposed to learn manual when no one's driving it."

Kelly: "You come to MY garage claiming you're some sort of good racer, car enthusiast, etc.
You don't even drive the proper cars. You can't do anything in an automatic!
In our world, when you shift means win or lose. You can't expect your car to know you're about to turn.
I can't do this. Tell Gomez I'm out."

James:

1. "Please, I'll learn if you teach me!"

2. "So, I don't drive manual. So what? Just get me in an auto and let me race!"

Kelly: "Look, man. You don't drive normal cars, you don't drive cars at all. 
I can't do this. I'm out. Go buy the car from Gomez, give it to Phantom's boy and get outta here.
This is not a world anyone can walk into. You don't have what it takes. We're done here."

Narrator: "And so, Kelly kicked James out of her garage. She judged him and, sadly, found him unworthy."

-----3 Days Later-----

Phantom: "You better fix this mess, Hector! You will not let a nobody disrespect everything I ever stood for!
Find him, kill him, and get me my car. NOW!"

The Demon: "Yes, sir."

Narrator: "And that's what James got into for running. Phantom has a problem with him, and that's never good.
Kelly can barely handle Phantom. It's true that James is a nobody.

And life caught up to the poor guy. Hector found him only 3 days later, and he killed him over a car.
In hopes to become a criminal racer, he got killed, and the game is over.
The lesson for next time is - when a game offers you free manual driving skills, by all means - take them."

GAME OVER
